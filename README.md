# Hi there, I'm Britney ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my Github page!

I am a **Junior Software Developer** and currently a student **@Northcoders**.

I have programmed in **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript** and **ABAP** (SAP) but have also dabbled in **C#** and **Typescript**.  
I have knowledge on **three** non-programme languages: English, Vietnamese and German.  

In my spare time I like to:
- *workout*
- *write creative stories*
- *create digital art*
- *pick up on more programming languages/skills (I like to learn and stay up-to-date with tech)*
